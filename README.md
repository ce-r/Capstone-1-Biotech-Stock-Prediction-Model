# Capstone-1-Biotech-Stock-Prediction-Model

This repository is soley dedicated to a Biotech Stock Prediction Project and contains the following items: 
10.6_ Capstone 1 Project Report.pdf, 10.6_ machine learning capstone 1 in depth analysis.pdf,	4.3_ Capstone 1 Project Proposal.pdf,	
5.4_ data wrangling.pdf	Add files via upload, 8.5_ Capstone 1 Statistical Data Analysis.pdf, 8.5_ milestone report capstone 1.pdf,	
Capstone 1 Biotechnology Stock Prediction SLIDES.pdf,	biotech_portfolio_optim_stock_selection.ipynb, biotechnology_exploration.ipynb	
capstone_1_biotech_models.ipynb

For coding directions, it is import to follow the ipynb's in chronological order: Part1 - Part3.

The pdf files illustrate the details of certain stages in the project. Capstone 1 Project Proposal.pdf is the final and 
definitive report. It captures the entire process from data wrangling to statistical analysis and machine learning model exploration. 
The ipynb files are various python implementations ranging from data retrieval to statistical analysis and model exploration.
